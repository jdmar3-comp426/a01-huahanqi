        <h1>What is Greek Mythology</h1>
        <p>Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of Ancient Greek folklore.
        These stories concern the origin and nature of the world, the lives and activities of deities,
        heroes, and mythological creatures, and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' own cult and ritual practices.
        Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better understand the nature of myth-making itself.</p>

            <h3>Literary Source</h3>
            <p>Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature. Nevertheless, the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus.
            This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends.
            [7]:1 Apollodorus of Athens lived from c. 180 BC to c. 125 BC and wrote on many of these topics. His writings may have formed the basis for the collection;
            however, the "Library" discusses events that occurred long after his death, hence the name Pseudo-Apollodorus.</p>
            <h3>Archaeological sources</h3>
            <p>The discovery of the Mycenaean civilization by the German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the nineteenth century, and the discovery of the Minoan civilization in Crete by the British archaeologist Arthur Evans in the twentieth century,
            helped to explain many existing questions about Homer's epics and provided archaeological evidence for many of the mythological details about gods and heroes.
            Unfortunately, the evidence about myths and rituals at Mycenaean and Minoan sites is entirely monumental, as the Linear B script (an ancient form of Greek found in both Crete and mainland Greece) was used mainly to record inventories,
            although certain names of gods and heroes have been tentatively identified.</p>

            <h2>Survey of mythic history</h2>
            <p>Greek mythology has changed over time to accommodate the evolution of their culture, of which mythology, both overtly and in its unspoken assumptions, is an index of the changes.
            In Greek mythology's surviving literary forms, as found mostly at the end of the progressive changes, it is inherently political, as Gilbert Cuthbertson (1975) has argued.</p>

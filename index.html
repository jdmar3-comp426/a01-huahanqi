        <h2>About Zeus</h2>
        <p>Zeus is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all other gods and men, and, consequently, 
        the chief figure in Greek mythology. The son of Cronus and Rhea, he is probably most famous for his infidelity to his sister and wife, Hera.  
        Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, and the Muses are all children of his numerous erotic affairs. 
        Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares are his legitimate children.

        <h3>Roles</h3>
        <p>Considered the ruler of heavens and the governor of weather, Zeus was also associated with wisdom and awareness, 
        with authority and destiny, with battles and power. In fact, Homer says that before the fight between Achilles and Hector, 
        Zeus weighed their lots and blessed the outcome. Further down, the poet even claims that Zeus owns two urns filled with ills and blessings – 
        the gifts which he gives to every mortal in the amount he decides.</p>

        <h2>Zeus' Biography</h2>
        <h3>Zeus' Family</h3>
        <p>Paradoxically, Zeus is both the youngest and the oldest son of Cronus and Rhea. 
            Namely, soon after the Creation of the world, the then-ruler of the Gods Cronus – 
            who had learned that one of his children would overthrow him – 
            swallowed Zeus’ three sisters and two brothers at birth: Demeter, Hera, Hestia, Hades, and Poseidon. 
            Zeus would have been eaten himself if Rhea hadn’t slipped Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes in his place, 
            hiding her youngest child in a cave on the Cretan Mount Ida.

        <h3>Zeus' Infancy</h3>
        <p>There, Zeus was raised by nymphs and met his first wife, Metis – or Wisdom. 
            On her advice, he masked himself as an Olympian cupbearer and tricked his father into drinking poisoned wine. 
            The wine made Cronus vomit so much that he ultimately disgorged Zeus’ siblings – intact and ready for revenge. 
            This, their second birth, made the youngest among them – Zeus – actually their oldest brother.
